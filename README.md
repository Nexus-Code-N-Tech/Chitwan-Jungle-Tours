### To-Do Refactor:

- [ ] Refactor `page.tsx`
- [ ] Refactor itinerary component

### Reminder:

- **Plans**: The UI is really awesome 👍

- **Itinerary**: Font size is too large for `lg`/`xl` sizes ❌

- **Contact**: Input spacing needs to be equal. This isn't critical due to budget constraints, so it can be ignored for now 👍

- **Gallery**: The top rhino image appears slightly larger on PC. No other issues 👍

- **Header**: Font issue for aprox md screen sizes. These is minor one, so can be ignored 👍

- **App/Page.tsx**: The whole page, including headers and footers, shifts unexpectedly. ❌

- Removed the floating social media icons.
